# hello-world
just another repository 
Hi, my name is Guy and I'm new to coding. I really want to know how to create websites and how to use the internet as an entrepreneur.  I have basic knowlege when it comes to computers being I come from a retail and customer servive background. however, online is no longer the future but the "NOW" and I'm ready to fully indulge and be a part of it.
